## P2: Project proposal and initial analyses

When you are done with Homework 1, you will continue to work on the next project milestone. In Milestone 2, together with your team members, you will agree on, and refine, your project proposal. Your first task is to select a project. Even though we provide the main dataset for you to use, it is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the data (including any additional data you might bring in yourself), and to perform initial analyses.

Note that we will support you in working with Quotebank data from 2015 to 2020, inclusive. You are, of course, free to use the data from other years if you wish so, but only if you are feeling adventurous! We have also prepared for you a Google Colab notebook with code to get you started with loading the dataset.

The goal of this milestone is to intimately acquaint yourself with the data, preprocess it and complete all the necessary descriptive statistics tasks. We expect you to have a pipeline in place, fully documented in a notebook, and show us that you have clear project goals.

When describing the relevant aspects of Quotebank data, and any other datasets you may intend to use, you should in particular show (non-exhaustive list):

-   That you can handle the data in its size.
-   That you understand what’s in the data (formats, distributions, missing values, correlations, etc.).
-   That you considered ways to enrich, filter, transform the data according to your needs.
-   That you have a reasonable plan and ideas for methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.
-   That your plan for analysis and communication is reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to your choices that you considered but dropped.
-   We will evaluate this milestone according to how well these steps have been done and documented, the quality of the code and its documentation, the feasibility and critical awareness of the project. We will also evaluate this milestone according to how clear, reasonable and well thought-through the project idea is. Please use the second milestone to really check with us that everything is in order with your project (idea, feasibility, etc.) before you advance too much with the final Milestone 3! There will be project office hours dedicated to helping you.

## P2 deliverable (done as a team): GitHub repository with the following:

Readme.md file containing the detailed project proposal (up to 1000 words). Your README.md should contain:

-   Title
-   Abstract: A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
-   Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
-   Proposed additional datasets (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.
-   Methods
-   Proposed timeline
-   Organization within the team: A list of internal milestones up until project Milestone 3.
-   Questions for TAs (optional): Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.
-   Notebook containing initial analyses and data handling pipelines. We will grade the correctness, quality of code, and quality of textual descriptions.

# Abstract

Quotes or comments made by important people on businesses and companies could have a major impact on the business’s stock price and even net sales. For example, not so long-ago Elon musk made a tweet that Tesla will stop accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment. Shortly after that, the bitcoin price dropped dramatically. It would be interesting to extract Elon Musk’s quotes and filter those that are related to other companies or products and see how these quotes affected the companies/products' stock price. The idea of the project is to evaluate the impact Elon musk has on the financial market and see if whether his words have so much influence on the financial world or not.
